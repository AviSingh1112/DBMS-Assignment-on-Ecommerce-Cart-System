# E-Commerce Shopping Cart System

This repository contains the Database Management System (DBMS) project for the course offered at SVKM’s NMIMS, School of Technology Management & Engineering for the academic year 2023-24. The project aims to design and implement a fully functional e-commerce shopping cart system.

## Project Team Members

- Arohi Agrawal (T009) - ER Diagram
- Arushi Dubey (T013) - Relational Model
- Divyendra Singh (T022) - Normalization, SQL Queries

## Project Overview

Our project, the E-Commerce Shopping Cart System, is designed to support artisans like Maya, enabling them to expand their customer base from local craft fairs to the global market through an online platform. The system features user-friendly interfaces for product browsing, cart management, and secure checkout processes.

### Features

- Product Browsing and Management
- Cart Functionality with secure checkout process
- Order Management
- User Authentication and Authorization
- Stock Management
- Dynamic Pricing and Discounts

### Technical Components

- **Database Design:** Includes Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD), Relational Models, and normalization up to Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF) to ensure efficient data management and integrity.
- **SQL Queries:** A comprehensive set of SQL queries for database manipulation, including product searches, price sorting, and customer order histories.

## Learning Outcomes

- Enhanced understanding of database design principles and normalization.
- Development of practical SQL query writing skills for real-world applications.
- Insights into e-commerce systems' functionality and challenges.
- Experience with problem-solving and optimization for database management.

## Installation

Please refer to the individual files within this repository for setup and installation instructions. Ensure to have a compatible DBMS environment to run the SQL queries and scripts provided.

## Usage

This project is structured to provide a conceptual framework for an e-commerce shopping cart system. To adapt this project for real-world applications, further development in terms of a front-end interface and integration with payment gateways is necessary.

## Contribution

This project is the result of collaborative efforts of our team. Contributions are detailed as follows:

- **Arohi Agrawal:** Designed the Entity Relationship Diagram to outline the database schema.
- **Arushi Dubey:** Developed the Relational Model, converting ER diagrams into a set of relational tables.
- **Divyendra Singh:** Focused on Normalization and SQL Query formulation for database interaction.

## Challenges and Learning

Throughout this project, we encountered and overcame challenges related to data modeling, handling product variations, managing stock levels, and optimizing database performance. These experiences have significantly contributed to our understanding of database systems in the context of e-commerce platforms.

## Conclusion

This DBMS project has been a comprehensive learning experience, showcasing the application of database management principles in the development of an e-commerce shopping cart system. We believe the skills acquired through this project will be invaluable in our future endeavors in technology and database management.
